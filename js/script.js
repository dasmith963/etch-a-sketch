// Create a 16x16 grid of square divs.

// Set up a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them
  // default color = black
  // reset() = white
  // color-picker: color value 
  // random RGB value
  // add 10% of black(or white) to color so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black (or white).
  

// Add a function to change number of squares per side for the new grid. 
  //  The existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before
